%A constraint $c$ is satisfiable if there exist an assignment $\delta : V_{c}\rightarrow D$ such that $\delta \models c$. The choice of variable name in the construction of formula will determine whether a composed constraint can be satisfied or not. 

%\input{subsections/ConstraintAutomata/proposition/Sat}

%In the case where the sets of free variables of two composed constraints intersect, the constraints are said to be in interactions and could no longer be satisfiable. If $c_1 := x=4 $ and $c_2 := x>5 $, the composed constraint $c := c_1 \land c_2 := x=4 \land x>5 $ is not satisfiable.
%\begin{example} Lets note $\underline{x}$ as a port variable, and build a constraint $c := \underline{a} = \underline{b}$.
%\end{example}

%\begin{note}	It is possible to encode independent progress on each state $q\in Q$ by adding a transition $(q,\phi,q)$ where $\phi$ represents the constraint where no ports involve on outgoing transitions fire.\end{note}

%Composition of constraint automata as defined in \cite{BSAR06} leads to a new constraint automaton. 

%\input{subsections/ConstraintAutomata/definition/composition}

%The composition of two constraint automata blindly compose constraints together. From the composed set of constraints, we can identified some formula that can never be satisfied (i.e. identify to $\bot$). In this case, the constraint and its associated transition can be removed from the automaton.
