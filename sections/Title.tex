\begin{abstract}
	Soft constraint automata extend constraint automata by associating, for each transition, a preference value from a csemiring. Preferences model concerns, and multiple concern can be involved in a single choice. We present a new framework to compose preferences of difference csemiring using a co-product. Since constraint automata have an interpretation as a boolean formula, we then investigate the interpretation of soft constraint automata as a semiring formula. 
	
	%The definition of a semiring logic requires a proper definition of product space of semiring.
	
%	Constraint automata have an logical interpretation that reduces state transition explosion.
%	Soft constraint automata, logic with csemiring, decoupling product from quotient, new composition operator.
